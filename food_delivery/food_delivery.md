# Abstract

Many restaurants offer a food delivery service. The customer selects a number of dishes from a menu, then calls the restaurant and orders the dishes. The restaurant prepares the dishes, packs them and delivers to the customer. Since a few years third party companies provide the selection and delivery service.

## AS IS process

A restaurant R advertises its offer of dishes and prices (either by setting up an informational web site, or by diffusing leaflets in its area). The restaurant manager receives orders by phone. Each order is sent to the kitchen where it is prepared and packaged. Then another employee of the restaurant takes the package and delivers it, using a vehicle (bike, car or else) owned by the restaurant. The employee, upon delivery, receives the payment by the customer and returns to the restaurant.

## TO BE process

Company FOOD sets up the infrastructure: a web site and employees for delivery. A restaurant R defines a general agreement with FOOD. Usually FOOD collects a fixed fee for the delivery, and retains a 10-15% share of the restaurant bill. When the agreement is defined R uploads on FOOD’s web site its offer (dishes and prices, operating hours, discount policies).

A customer accesses FOOD’s web site, where she selects one of the restaurants (say R), selects dishes, gives her address, pays via credit card. The manager of restaurant R collects the order from FOOD’s web site, passes the order to the kitchen that prepares and packages. An employee from FOOD collects the package and delivers to the customer.

The delivery employee uses an app to interact with FOOD. The customer, via the FOOD web site, can rate the service and add a tip for the delivery employee.
